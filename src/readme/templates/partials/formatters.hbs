{{#if formatters}}
### **Editor setup**

To keep consistency to the style of resources, I decided to stick to some shared rules that have to be applied to every
project using some editors plugins. Plese be sure to disable / remove any other linters or custom configurations.

I have chosen to use

{{#each formatters}}
- [{{uppercase this}}](https://www.google.com/search?q={{lowercase this}})
{{/each}}

This
works including a specific `.dotfile` in the root directory and making sure your editor has the necessary plugin.
